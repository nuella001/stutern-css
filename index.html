            <h1>My Love For Technology!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is <b>Egbo Chioma Emmanuella</b>
                I've come to love Technology as it's now part of me. <br>
                Technology has pretty much impacted all other careers and industry, the products of sophisticated
                algorithms
                and advanced quantum computing achieve wonders in medicine, astronomy, the search for extraterrestrial
                life
                and even things that were once perceived as impossible. <br>

                Technology has powered, is powering and yet to power all the best inventions in
                the
                foreseeable future. In just about every area of life, from medicine to education, from business to
                government, from entertainment to well being, from communication to transportation, from art to science
                to
                pretty much every imaginable area. Technology is the future and the future is now. <br>
                Building a career in tech is one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made. it has coerced me to learn other soft
                skills which are as important, skills such as team work and collaboration, communication, problem
                solving, Research and Inter-personal relationship. I look forward to growing my career, solving world
                problems and connecting with amazing personalities all around the globe while deriving joy and happiness
                in what I do.

            <h1>What I've Learnt at Stutern!</h1>
            <p>It's been an amazing ride so far, from meeting with amazing Peers and Mentors
                to learning the internet and how the internet works, the client and server side and how the requests
                made in the browser are sent to the server through <b>HTTP</b> which means <b>hypertext transfer
                    protocol</b> and in turn the server responds with the html,css and javascript files if the request
                is ok.
                I learnt Git as a version control system and github and the way teams work with github.I learnt git
                commands like git init, git add, git commit,git push, git pull, git fetch, git merge, creating pull
                requests and so on.
                I've also learnt html which is the hypertext markup language, It's basically the structure of the
                webpage. I learnt the tags, elements such as the paragraph,link,body,head including semantic tags
                such as heading,section,footer,aside and what each of them does.
                I'm currently learning css with my fellow peers here in Stutern and it has been quite enjoyable watching
                the html skeleton have a pretty look after styling them in the <b>CSS</b> file which means <i>Cascading
                    style sheet</i> CSS is very important because it make web pages more attractive and lively,
                balancing the principles of design such as typography, colors,size, harmony brings about a cool visual
                effect which will attract your users and will make them wanting to spend more time on your web page.

            <h1>The Css Box Model</h1>
            <p>
                The box Model is a very crucial part of Css. I have come to learn and understand the differences between
                borders,padding and margin and I'd be elated to share with youüòç
                Think of it like a box, yes a Box! hence the name Box Model.
                the box model comprises of:
            <ul>
                <li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
                <li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
                <li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
                <li> Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
            </ul>
            relating it with a jewelry box for example, the content is ur jewelry,
            the padding defines a space between your jewelry and the edges of the box.
            the border is the edges of the box whereas the margin is the space between the jewelry box and other items around it. hopefully you understand better nowüòä
